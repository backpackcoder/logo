Backpack Coder Logo
===================

This is the code to generate my logo.  My idea was that I could write the javascript to generate the standard hiker
icon (a walking stiok figure) and then apply the actual formatted code as the background for the icon.

My first iteration just renders it to an html page and requires a bunch of cut and paste.
